<h1 class = "firsthead"> ABOUT US </h1>
<br>

<p class = "firstpar"> 
	We at Sugar City Trains realized the need to bridge the gap between the history of St. Kitts, specifically, Basseterre
	and persons, both visitors and locals alike. We thought the way to do this best was by a guided tour on our train, the Sugar
	City Train. So many historical icons exist in Basseterre alone each one representing our tragic past and how we over came each struggle. 
	 
 </p>
 
 <p class = "firstpar"> 
	The company is pleased to be able to provide this service with a professional and experienced staff. All our tour guides and drivers are certified
	by our very own St. Kitts Tourism Authority and boast of experience in the field. So let's time travel through Basseterre and 
	become more appreciative of the Kittitian story.
 </p>
<br> 

<h1 class = "firsthead"> OUR ROUTE </h1>
<br>

<p class = "firstpar"> 
	We begin our journey from Port Zante, where we then travel to the island main road. We then turn up Church Street and turn left on 
	that road. We journey past the monuments and onwards to Heros Park. We then take a stop at the park for pictures and fact learning. Afterwards we go on the 
	island main road and travel on the Bay Road. We continue past the Industrial Park, afterwards we return to Port Zante for the end of our tour.
